## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.11.20` Update

- Added `MeshBase::elem_orders()`, `MeshBase::max_nodal_order()`, etc.
  APIs.  This will soon allow middleware code to do additional sanity
  checking of user variable order choices, or to automatically choose
  an isoparametric variable order when appropriate.
- Added triangularization and tetrahedralization support to `meshtool`
  app.
- Added the ability to condense out "element-internal" degrees of
  freedom when building algebraic systems.  This gives smaller
  algebraic systems to solve, without "bubble function" coefficients
  in continuous FEM methods or internal degrees of freedom in HDG
  methods.
- Added `NonManifoldGhostingFunctor` class, which can be used to give
  reliable distributed-mesh connectivity on meshes where multiple edge
  elements meet at the same point and/or multiple face elements meet
  along the same edge.
- Added `SidesToElemMap` class, for caching that "reverse connectivity"
  in classes like the `NonManifoldGhostingFunctor` that use it.
- Generalized `MeshFunction::find_element()` allowing evaluation of a
  `MeshFunction` on algebraically-ghosted elements when a `GHOSTED`
  vector is in use.
- Added `SimplexRefiner` class, which currently supports refinement of
  simplicial (edge, triangle, and/or tetrahedral) meshes via edge
  bisection.
- Exit with error when asked to evaluate `L2_HIERARCHIC` bases of
  polynomial degree `p=0`.  Previously this case was returning an
  incomplete basis that would deliver suboptimal convergence.
- Use more accurate projections when decimating solutions on `H_DIV`
  finite elements for visualization output.
- Optimizations to `SparseMatrix::read_matlab()`
- Added `--with-xdr-libdir` option to `configure`, making it possible
  to build libMesh with XDR support using more types of third-party
  library installations.
- Better `configure --help` entries for NetCDF options
- `configure` now autodetects the Fortran compiler from PETSc where
  possible
- Fixes for `make check` NetCDF tests when combining older NetCDF with
  newer HDF5
- Support for distributed-and-unprepared meshes in `all_tri()`
- Compatibility fixes for PETSc 3.23
- Support for adding a prefix when querying a
  `PetscNonlinearSolver::snes()` that might have yet to be initialized
- Added `NumericVector::set_type()`, deprecated older `type()` setter
  that returned a writeable reference.  This will eventually make more
  flexible changes to vector type possible.
- Fixes for libMesh-based error reporting without a `LibMeshInit`
  object active.  This corrected a regression in the error handling of
  the libMesh `fparser-parse` utility.
- Fixes in Reduced Basis EIM code
