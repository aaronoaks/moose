### Checkpoint system updates

After receiving user feedback, MOOSE's checkpoint system has been updated:

- By default, checkpoints are now written every 60 minutes of elapsed wall time (increased from 10 minutes).
- The `Outputs/wall_time_checkpoint=false` syntax is introduced as an easy way to turn off automatic checkpoint output. Before this change, the only way to turn it off was to set `Outputs/Checkpoint/wall_time_interval` to a number of seconds longer than the total simulation wall time.
- An informative block is output to the MOOSE header in the console output describing the configuration of the checkpoint system for each simulation.
- Checkpoints are now written in compressed ASCII (.cpa.gz) format instead of binary (.cpr) format. This allows checkpoints to be output on systems without XDR support. Reading and writing binary checkpoint files is no longer supported.
